### Q&A

1. How would you manage state in a large-scale React app?

   > We can use React Context API or use a state management library like Zustand or Redux.

2. How would you optimize performance in React using useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback?

   > We can use useEffect to fetch data and update the state, useMemo to memoize the filtered users, and useCallback to memoize the search handler.

3. How would you ensure accessibility in the User Directory component?

   > We can use ARIA roles and attributes to ensure accessibility in the User Directory component.
